        Hello! My name is Bradley, I bought this domain just to say I own one and I didn't really think i'd end up coding my own website, it's quite basic however hope to use it as a learning curve. Overall, this website is just going to be full of loads of junk which I can be bothered to put on here.<div>You can find my twitter <a href="https://x.com/bradleymaynard0" target="_blank">here!</a></div> <div>Further, you can recieve my daily horse racing tips from the tips tab at the top.</div>
